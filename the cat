     <h1>This is a virus</h1>
     <h2>Lock your doors...</h2>
     <p>In your pursuit of financial gain, you unintentionally fell victim to a cyber threat and inadvertently downloaded a virus onto your device. As a result, your system may be compromised, and your personal information and financial data may be at risk. It's crucial to take immediate steps to mitigate the damage by disconnecting from the internet, running security scans, and considering professional assistance if necessary. Remember to prioritize security over short-term gains, as the consequences of a cyber attack far outweigh any potential benefits.. Clicking on random links in a website can be risky. These links can lead you to malicious websites that may contain viruses or install malware on your device. Such threats can cause damage to your device, steal your personal information, and even hack into your bank accounts. Therefore, it's important to be cautious before clicking on an unknown link. It's recommended to only click on links from reputable sources, preferably ones you trust and are familiar with. Just be glad that this is not an actual virus and only a warning.</p>
